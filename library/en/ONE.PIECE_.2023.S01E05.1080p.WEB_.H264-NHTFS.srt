1
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,804
{\an8}Did you just call that guy Grandpa?

2
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:25,025
Hoist the yard!
Batten down the hatches!

3
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,318
Raise the mizzenmast, men!

4
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,112
Prepare to board.

5
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,323
Our ship is ready to sail.

6
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,659
What's the meaning of this?

7
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,204
Grandpa, it's my first ship.

8
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,791
How do you expect to be a Marine
when you're wasting your time on this?

9
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,793
I don't want to be a Marine.

10
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,087
I'm a pirate!

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,969
No!

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,220
Grandpa, don't!

13
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,972
Stop! It's my ship!

14
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,943
Your training begins today.

15
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,740
But first...

16
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,657
Let me go!

17
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,909
...lunch.

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,289
No, let me go! I'm a pirate!

19
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,334
Hit the deck!

20
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,928
Everybody okay?

21
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,011
I think so.

22
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,599
No. Not okay. Not even close to okay.

23
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,561
Usopp, fire back at them!

24
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,648
Or how about we sail away
as fast as we can?

25
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,942
Run from the Marines?

26
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,819
No. Never!

27
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,155
Nami, trim the... the sail thing.
Let's sink their ship.

28
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,574
We don't have time.
They're stealing our wind.

29
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,660
If they pull up alongside us,
we're finished.

30
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:04,666
- You're the navigator. Do something.
- Zoro, sheet in and hard to port!

31
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,167
- You know how to load a cannon?
- Yeah, of course.

32
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,504
I've loaded thousands of 'em.

33
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,298
Uh, this must be a different model
than I'm used to.

34
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,509
- Which way is port?
- The left!

35
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,720
Usopp, load the cannon in the barrel.
Light the fuse.

36
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,430
Then get the hell out of the way!

37
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,684
- Ooh. Ooh. Oh.
- Usopp!

38
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,203
- What the...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

39
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,106
Ooh!

40
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,029
Oh man.

41
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,245
We've got a clear view of their hull, sir.
Permission to fire?

42
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,955
No kill shots.

43
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,207
I want these pirates taken alive.

44
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,875
Give me that.

45
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,255
Pirate vessel,

46
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,674
by order of the Marines,

47
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,802
lower your sails
and submit to my authority.

48
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,721
Never!

49
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,391
All right, you brat. Have it your way.

50
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,895
Oh.

51
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,648
Not bad, boy.

52
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,067
Not bad.

53
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,738
That was amazing.

54
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,866
- You saved us!
- You didn't tell me you could do that.

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,243
I didn't know I could.

56
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,747
Yeah!

57
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,751
Yeah! Ah!

58
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,712
Nami, get us out of here.

59
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,463
On it.

60
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,425
Let's disappear.

61
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,783
- How's the ship look?
- Broken railing.

62
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,995
Minor damage. Could've been a lot worse.

63
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,789
- Could've been better.
- Can't see the Marines anywhere.

64
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,083
Can't see anything in this soup.

65
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,876
What we need is a place to lay low,

66
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,337
wait out any reinforcements
they send after us.

67
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,089
My charts are useless in this fog.

68
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,924
What did Luffy say?

69
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,927
He's on the bow. He hasn't said anything
since we hightailed it.

70
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:07,056
Well, somebody needs to talk to him.
About this and that other thing.

71
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,060
- What other thing?
- Oh, gee, I wonder.

72
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,315
The vice-admiral-of-the-Marines-
is-my-grandfather thing.

73
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,191
Oh, that.

74
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,736
Yeah, I don't really
know the guy that well.

75
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,529
Doesn't seem like a big deal.

76
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:27,118
You're his first mate. Kind of seems like
that falls under your job description,

77
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,201
hmm?

78
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,914
Fine.

79
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,346
Hey, how you doing?

80
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,851
Great. But my hat took a couple of hits
during the battle.

81
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,144
Right.

82
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,065
About the battle, you wanna talk about it?

83
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,148
Nope.

84
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,026
Okay, good talk.

85
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,446
He seems fine to me.

86
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,281
Did you even ask him?

87
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,532
Hey!

88
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,161
You guys smell that?

89
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,498
Smell what?

90
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,210
There's something on the breeze.

91
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,254
Smells like butter.

92
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,385
Soy sauce.

93
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,554
And meat.

94
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,641
I can't smell anything.

95
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,394
- Think he has brain damage?
- I think that every day.

96
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,729
Look, Luffy,
playing follow the smell is fun and all,

97
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,273
but we really got to get out of this fog.

98
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,401
I know, but I smell food,

99
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,905
which means that there's
someone somewhere cooking.

100
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,208
Five degrees starboard!

101
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,254
No! No! Three degrees back to port.

102
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,590
Add food to the equation
and suddenly he knows how to navigate.

103
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,674
What is that?

104
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,010
Is that land?

105
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,680
Can't be. There aren't any Islands
anywhere near here.

106
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,525
What's a... baratie?

107
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,434
Everyone's going to that fish ship.

108
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,981
That smell.
I think this place is a restaurant.

109
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,900
Then I know what we're gonna do next.

110
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,027
Disguise the ship
so the Marines can't find us?

111
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,070
Sail back to Syrup Village
where it's safe?

112
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,155
Nah.

113
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,323
Let's eat!

114
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,826
That fish better have a bar.

115
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,669
Welcome to Baratie. How can I help you?

116
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,548
- Hi! Where do we eat?
- Do you have a reservation, sir?

117
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,885
- Do we need one?
- We're very full today.

118
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,430
I could put you on the waiting list.
It's three weeks out.

119
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,017
Maybe you want to check your book again.

120
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,980
You wouldn't want to turn away
the future King of the Pirates, would you?

121
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,313
And who is that, sir?

122
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,065
Monkey D. Luffy.

123
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,651
Perhaps you've heard of him?

124
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,071
Well, in that case, we'll find a table.

125
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,364
Yeah! I knew it.

126
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,199
In three weeks.

127
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,703
You'll have to excuse them.
They're idiots.

128
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,788
Of course.

129
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,544
- Right this way, ma'am.
- See? Works every time.

130
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,635
Ah!

131
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,483
I'd be happy
to check your swords for you, sir.

132
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,734
I got this.

133
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,153
Very good.

134
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:40,580
Here are your menus.
Your waiter will be with you shortly.

135
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,209
I wonder what kind of food they have here.

136
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,147
- Get a move on. You're slowing the line.
- Gotta wait for the sauce to cool.

137
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,922
- I didn't see this on tonight's menu.
- It's called imagination, Patty.

138
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,490
- Wouldn't expect you to understand.
- Wanna take this outside?

139
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,742
Are you asking me to dance?

140
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,661
'Cause I kind of had
my eye on that blonde at table eight.

141
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,288
You better keep your eye on the menu.

142
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,957
Whatever the hell that is,
boss man ain't gonna like it.

143
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,041
Order up!

144
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,586
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

145
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,382
- What the hell is this?
- I call it a True Bluefin Sauté.

146
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,219
It's elephant tuna, seared asparagus,
in a sweet soy reduction.

147
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,780
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

148
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,139
Well, I call it crap.

149
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,767
The day Baratie serves a dish like that,
little eggplant,

150
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,852
is the day that hell freezes over.

151
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,854
If I gotta sling
one more prime rib medium-well,

152
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,107
I am going to drop dead of boredom,
you old shitbag!

153
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,652
- It's what we serve.
- It's an insult to the meat.

154
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,278
You don't like cooking our menu? Fine.

155
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,198
'Cause I'll be more than delighted
to give you other work elsewhere.

156
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,659
In fact, you are off the line.

157
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,204
Now get out there and wait tables. Move!

158
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,502
I am saying, this here is my table.

159
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,046
Close to the kitchen
so I can smell the beef.

160
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:16,509
Maybe you ought to try a table outside.
Right now, the only thing I smell is you.

161
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,804
Now, now, gentlemen.

162
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,057
You know the rules here.
We don't waste food,

163
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,101
and there is no fighting at Baratie.

164
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,184
No.

165
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,605
This ain't gonna be a fight.
I'm just going to kill him.

166
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,606
Like to see you try.

167
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,818
I'd like to pour you each a glass
of Ithürzburger Stein. On the house.

168
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,237
Okay, I'll have that drink.

169
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,032
- After he apologizes for his bad manners.
- Over my dead body.

170
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,376
Good fighter.

171
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,135
No cause for alarm, folks.
Please enjoy your meals.

172
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,680
Hi, welcome to our shitty restaurant

173
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,307
where the only thing
worse than the ambience is the food.

174
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,268
My name is Sanji. What can I get for you?

175
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,478
- One of everything, please.
- Any drinks?

176
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,356
One of our signature cocktails
to help you choke down your meal?

177
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,941
Giving us the hard sell, huh?

178
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,738
Apologies, madam, I didn't see you there.
Would you care for an apéritif to start?

179
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,948
We have several
rare Micqueot vintages in stock.

180
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,950
Or perhaps you'd like a glass of Umeshu?

181
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,245
You know, something sweet
for someone sweet.

182
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,665
- Something wrong with your eye?
- Just blinded by your beauty.

183
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,626
Waiter, can I get a beer
and something for my friends?

184
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,671
- Two beers. I usually have three, but...
- And a milk.

185
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,049
Three beers and a milk.
And, uh, for madam?

186
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,133
Water.

187
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,345
Still, sparkling, mineral?
With ice or without? Cubed or crushed?

188
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,849
Regular water in a regular glass. Thanks.

189
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,142
Right away.

190
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,728
Ah!

191
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,565
- What?
- Nothing.

192
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,360
Madam. Forgive my rude behavior, madam.

193
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,030
Would madam prefer her water
in a crystal glass,

194
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,783
or would a golden bowl
be more madam's style?

195
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,202
Nami's got a boyfriend.

196
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,541
You guys are the worst.

197
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,388
Damage report?

198
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,808
We're making progress, sir,
but the ship needs repairs.

199
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,771
We've got to shore up the yard,
reinforce the...

200
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,978
- How long till we sail?
- At least a day. Maybe two.

201
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,065
Sir, the 77th Marine Branch
is running training exercises nearby.

202
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,942
- They could be here in a few hours.
- No.

203
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,654
We don't need their help.

204
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,240
If we delay,
we might lose track of Luffy entirely.

205
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,407
No SOS calls.

206
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,036
We'll handle this problem on our own.

207
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,841
Hello.

208
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,929
Mihawk, did I catch you
in the middle of something?

209
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,894
Just killing some time.

210
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,569
What can I do for you, Vice-Admiral?

211
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:26,031
I've a request for you.
One that suits your particular talents.

212
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,283
Who's the quarry?

213
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,622
A young upstart named Luffy.

214
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,875
Fancies himself a pirate.

215
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,631
Doesn't sound like much of a challenge.

216
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,929
<i>Oh no, no, no.
Don't underestimate this one.</i>

217
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,472
He's a wild card.

218
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,433
One moment.

219
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,239
That's enough!

220
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,204
I'm afraid it's time I ended this.

221
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:25,341
You've killed my men, destroyed my fleet.

222
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,968
Why are you after me?

223
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,846
You woke me from my nap.

224
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,891
Then allow me to make it permanent!

225
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,742
Such a disappointing final gambit.

226
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,879
<i>Apologies, Vice-Admiral.</i>

227
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,967
You've piqued my interest.
Where am I headed?

228
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,136
East Blue. Sambas region.

229
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,347
And, Mihawk,

230
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,810
bring him alive by any means necessary.

231
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,065
I can't eat another bite.

232
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,984
But it's so good.

233
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,362
- Oh man, you said it.
- I'm not gonna be hungry for a week.

234
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,948
- Should we order dessert?
- I already got mine.

235
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:31,865
Mmm.

236
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,869
That reminds me. We should do a toast.
Come on. Grab your glasses.

237
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:42,209
To the best crew sailing on the sea
and to our victory! Yeah!

238
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,711
No, I'm sorry.

239
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,337
What victory exactly?

240
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,133
Against the Marines.
Our very first battle and we crushed them.

241
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,969
I don't know how many naval battles
you guys have been part of...

242
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,972
- Two dozen, at least.
- But that was a disaster.

243
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,724
We were unprepared, uncoordinated.

244
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,184
By all rights,
we should be at the bottom of the sea.

245
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,228
We're not though. Luffy saved us.

246
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,233
Are we really going to ignore
the elephant in the room right now?

247
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,945
You didn't think to mention
your grandfather was a Marine?

248
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,072
And not just any Marine, a vice-admiral!

249
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,036
Don't know about you.
I didn't sign up for that.

250
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:18,954
You raided a Marine base.
Of course that'll make you a target.

251
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,158
If I stole the map,
no one would've known I was there,

252
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,043
as opposed to wrecking
a base commander's office.

253
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,252
Your bill, sir.

254
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,297
Ah.

255
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,430
Thank you, my good man.

256
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,809
No, sir. Thank you.

257
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,106
I'm not saying it's good
that the Marines are on our tail,

258
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,611
but we showed them
that they can't just roll over us.

259
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:54,782
This crew, our crew, can handle anything.

260
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,534
Who the hell is Monkey D. Luffy?

261
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,454
Here.

262
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,956
You seem to be confused
about the rules of the house,

263
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,084
but Baratie doesn't offer credit.

264
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,878
You eat, you pay.

265
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,547
I think you're confused.

266
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,927
The meal has already been paid for.
I just haven't given you the money yet.

267
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,011
Yeah, and how's that?

268
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,180
You can add it to my treasure tab.

269
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,516
And what, pray tell, is that?

270
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,227
I may not look like a big deal yet,

271
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,771
but you're talking
with the future King of the Pirates.

272
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,232
And as soon as I find the One Piece,
I'm gonna come back,

273
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,150
pay this bill in full,

274
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,194
and with interest.

275
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,517
I got a better idea.

276
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,451
I need a drink.

277
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,078
Yeah. Now you're talking.

278
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,415
You, Mr. Future-King-of-the-Pirates,
are gonna be my new chore boy.

279
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,335
You're gonna pay off your debt
washing dishes.

280
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,382
- All of these?
- For starters.

281
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,926
You gotta remember.
The meal you had with your friends?

282
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,886
That's one year's worth of dishes.

283
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,015
I'd get a move on if I was you.
Second service is in one hour.

284
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,854
- Oy, oy. What do you think you're doing?
- Come on, old man. Enough's enough.

285
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,065
Put the jacket back on, little eggplant.
You're not done with your shift yet.

286
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,109
Let me back on the line or I walk.

287
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,111
You can walk back into the ocean
for all I care.

288
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,948
Cook another meal like that in my kitchen,
it's going right where the last one did.

289
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:22,202
You can kick me out of the kitchen
all you like. I'll never be a waiter.

290
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:26,373
That's fine by me. You sure as hell are
never gonna be a cook in my restaurant.

291
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,456
Have you got it?

292
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,061
Pace yourself.

293
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,733
I don't even think there's liquor in this.
It tastes just like candy.

294
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,069
Last time I said that,
I woke up face down under a table.

295
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,324
That glass have gold on the bottom
or what?

296
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,535
- Hmm?
- You haven't stopped staring at it.

297
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,498
You seriously don't think
what Luffy did is messed up?

298
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,295
Yeah. He should've told us.

299
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,505
But in case you didn't notice,

300
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,716
we've been making enemies
everywhere we go.

301
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:22,262
Psycho clowns, killer butlers.
What's a vice-admiral gonna do to us?

302
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,889
No, you don't get it.

303
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,892
I can't get caught. Not when I'm so close...

304
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,441
Uh, who's ready for another drink?
My treat.

305
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:35,942
Mmm.

306
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,319
My favorite kind of drink.

307
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,159
Let me get your second-best bottle of rum.

308
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,911
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

309
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,957
If I wanted to secure passage to
the Conomi Islands, who would I talk to?

310
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,333
Uh, that'd be me.

311
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,712
It'll cost you.

312
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,756
- Six thousand.
- I have Berry.

313
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,176
Need room for your friends too?

314
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,974
No. Just me.

315
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,269
I'm at slip 22.

316
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,437
Be ready to sail at dawn.

317
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,877
I know I'm going to regret this,
but what's wrong?

318
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,671
Nothing.

319
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,053
What you said back at Syrup Village

320
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,763
about Garp...

321
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,146
- I'm starting to think you might be right.
- What is it, my birthday?

322
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,939
Of course I'm right.

323
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,448
You ever hear of anyone called Mihawk?

324
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,618
Best swordsman in the world?

325
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,663
Better with a blade
than anyone in living history?

326
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,501
- One of the Seven Warlords of the Seas?
- Warlords?

327
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:23,050
Years ago, there were
these seven incredibly powerful pirates,

328
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,510
each one worse than the next.

329
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,095
They ruled the seas,

330
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,349
terrorizing everyone they came across.

331
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,934
The World Government
could've gone after them,

332
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,228
but that would've meant an all-out war.

333
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:41,151
They realized it'd be more useful
to keep them close, as allies.

334
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,154
So they struck a deal to work together.

335
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,283
Why would the Marines
need to work with pirates?

336
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,911
To do the things
they didn't want tied back to them.

337
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,997
In exchange,
the Warlords were given free rein.

338
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,082
To do pirate stuff?

339
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,335
Illegal pirate stuff?

340
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,715
Koby, you may know how to tie a knot,

341
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,636
but you don't know shit
about how the world works.

342
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,362
Hey, chore boy,

343
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,531
how's that dish pile coming along?

344
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,908
Never seems to get any smaller.

345
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,910
The old man's a real piece of work.

346
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,331
- Bet you regret giving him that IOU.
- I don't really do regret.

347
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,126
- No point in looking back.
- Lucky you.

348
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,295
Sometimes, when I try to look ahead,
all I see is back.

349
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,884
- How long you been a waiter?
- Not a waiter. I'm a cook.

350
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,511
Best one in the East Blue.

351
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,013
Not that it matters.

352
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,641
As long as the old man's in charge,
I'm banned from the line.

353
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:58,270
- But that meal you cooked was incredible.
- The True Bluefin Sauté?

354
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,771
- Yeah.
- You tried it?

355
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,983
Yeah, of course I did.
I couldn't help myself.

356
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,861
I didn't think the food here
could get any better.

357
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,406
You know, you're a really good cook.

358
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,700
- Eh.
- Why is Zeff making you wait tables?

359
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,903
'Cause he's jealous.

360
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,191
I should be running this place,

361
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,371
but the old man's so stubborn,
it'll never happen.

362
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,707
So that's your dream.

363
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,209
To be head chef of the Baratie.

364
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,793
Nah.

365
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:29,050
So you love to cook.
You just don't want to cook here?

366
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,018
There's, um, this place

367
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,564
where you can find ingredients
from all four seas.

368
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,735
East Blue, West Blue, North, and South.
They call it the All Blue.

369
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,154
Nobody knows where it is, but

370
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,991
there's fish there
that have never been seen.

371
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:58,205
You know, rare seaweeds.
Spices that have never been tasted.

372
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:03,793
It is a cook's paradise,
and I'm gonna find it one day.

373
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,296
That's my dream.

374
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,133
If you want to cook, you should cook.

375
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:17,641
Don't let some stubborn old man
get in the way of your dream.

376
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:20,977
Stand up to him.

377
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,146
Tell him what you want.

378
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,651
It's more complicated than that.

379
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,029
I don't really do complicated either.

380
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,157
Help me.

381
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,827
Help!

382
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,954
Please.

383
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,915
Help me.

384
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,592
- Are you okay?
- I'm so hungry. Please.

385
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,470
Okay, you got it, man. How does
some corned-beef fried rice sound?

386
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,348
- What do you think you're doing?
- At Baratie, everyone eats.

387
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,559
Who's gonna pay for that?
This is a business.

388
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,812
We can't give handouts to every
down-on-his-luck pirate that washes up.

389
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,022
If a man is hungry, I feed him.

390
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,777
- Zeff kicked you off the line.
- I don't see the old man here. Do you?

391
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:12,862
Your funeral.

392
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,009
I was drifting out there for a week.

393
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,928
You saved my life tonight.

394
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,807
You're not only a good cook.
You're a good guy.

395
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,184
If Zeff doesn't appreciate you,

396
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,477
you should join my crew.

397
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,482
I'm serious. For real.

398
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,365
Sorry, chore boy. I've already got a job.

399
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,700
But you're not happy here.

400
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,120
And we're gonna need a great cook
if we're gonna find the One Piece.

401
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,080
The One Piece?

402
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,709
Yeah, I'm gonna find it
and become King of the Pirates.

403
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,544
We were searching for it too.

404
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,799
I was part of a mighty pirate armada.

405
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,347
Our captain was hell-bent
on finding Gold Roger's treasure, but

406
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,016
the Grand Line was his undoing.

407
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,687
We lost 50 ships and 5,000 men.

408
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,939
I was the only survivor.

409
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,275
Save yourself.

410
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,155
Forget you ever heard of the One Piece.

411
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,376
He does have a certain grace about him.

412
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,879
Like a frantic, uncoordinated...

413
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,839
- Sea slug.
- That's it.

414
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,507
That's what he's like.

415
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,220
Look at him.
Like he doesn't have a care in the world.

416
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,349
What are you carrying around
that's so heavy?

417
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,268
- You have no idea.
- I bet I do.

418
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,565
I bet I know more about you
than you do about me.

419
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,318
- Yeah, right. You're an open book.
- Care to prove it?

420
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,074
I guess something about you, you drink.

421
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,412
You guess something about me, I drink.

422
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,499
Go ahead.

423
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,920
Tell me all about myself.

424
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,922
I bet you grew up in a big city,

425
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,258
running schemes,

426
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,845
hanging out in swanky bars like this one.

427
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,723
- You must be thirsty.
- You're saying I'm wrong?

428
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,229
I grew up in a small village.
Barely a village.

429
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:55,150
Just a handful of houses
in the center of a tangerine grove.

430
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,987
Drink.

431
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,368
Ah.

432
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,914
- Your turn.
- Okay.

433
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,959
But I had you read
all the way back in Orange Town.

434
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,171
I'll bet you didn't have any friends
as a kid.

435
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,464
I had friends.

436
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,715
Swords don't count.

437
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,097
I had one friend.

438
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,479
Hell, one more than I had.

439
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,525
Drink.

440
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,609
Drink.

441
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,457
Should I come back later, sir?

442
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,042
No, no.

443
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,922
I'm almost done here.

444
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,590
What is it, cadet?

445
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,302
Is it true
you're sending Dracule Mihawk after Luffy?

446
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,013
That's a nasty habit,

447
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,641
listening at doorways.

448
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,267
I heard what I heard, sir.

449
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,206
It seems there are different rules
for different pirates.

450
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,564
And the ocean is blue.

451
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,403
- Is there anything else?
- It's just...

452
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,533
I signed an oath to protect people,

453
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,244
to treat everyone equally under the law.

454
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,745
And if that's not the case...

455
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,251
maybe I'm not meant to be a Marine.

456
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,876
Hmm.

457
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,170
Have a seat, son.

458
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,606
I joined the Marines over 50 years ago.

459
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,068
A green recruit like yourself.

460
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,613
I came in with simple ideals,
but I had to adapt,

461
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,241
because the world is not a simple place.

462
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,412
The same set of laws
do not apply to everyone.

463
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,746
But that's not fair.

464
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,830
No, it's not.

465
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,626
But you have to decide
if you can live with that.

466
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,839
I could've been fleet admiral by now,

467
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:25,508
but I always turned down the promotion.
Do you know why?

468
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,888
Because I'd have to do things their way.

469
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,807
I'd lose my freedom.

470
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,101
Do you understand?

471
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,355
Yes, sir.

472
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,815
The world is not fair.

473
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:48,156
But the Marines are all that are standing
between order and anarchy.

474
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,326
So, let me ask you...

475
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,913
can you live with that?

476
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,583
I think so.

477
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,209
Hmm.

478
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,216
That uniform.

479
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,846
It's starting to fit you after all.

480
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:20,021
And then they aimed
their biggest, baddest cannons at us.

481
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,983
But I wasn't scared,

482
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,070
being that I'm the best shot
in the East Blue.

483
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,198
So I fired at 'em.

484
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,075
And again.

485
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,034
And again.

486
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,870
Boom, boom, boom.

487
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,873
Down goes their yard.
Marines dead in the water.

488
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,543
All thanks to the great Captain Usopp.

489
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,627
So,

490
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,838
you're the captain?

491
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,550
Well, technically, no.

492
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,304
But I did distract them so that Luffy,

493
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,598
who's, like, the official captain,

494
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,685
could bounce that ball back. Boom.

495
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,397
I should very much like
to meet this Luffy.

496
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,566
Sure.

497
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,029
Heck, come meet the whole crew.

498
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,909
Guys, meet my new best friend.

499
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:19,747
- What did you say your name was again?
- Which one of you is Monkey D. Luffy?

500
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,791
Who wants to know?

501
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,087
You're Dracule Mihawk.

502
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,634
I have business with your captain.

503
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,303
If you know what's good for you,
you'll hand him over.

504
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,515
We don't know anyone named Luffy.
Right, Zoro?

505
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,433
Zoro?

506
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,605
I've been following your career
since I was a child.

507
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,692
- It's an honor to finally meet you, sir.
- Thank you.

508
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,486
Which is why it pains me

509
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,280
to inform you that tomorrow...

510
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,451
you're going to die.

511
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,534
Wait, what?

512
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:02,999
I, Roronoa Zoro, challenge you to a duel

513
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,501
to the death.

514
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,676
I've never heard of you.

515
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,845
They call me the Demon Pirate Hunter.

516
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:21,476
But my lifelong dream
is to best you in single combat

517
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,063
and become
the greatest swordsman in the world.

518
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,398
You're serious.

519
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,900
Accept my challenge.

520
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,819
You'll see how serious I am.

521
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,362
Very well.

522
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,743
Tomorrow at dawn.

523
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,038
And when I'm done with you, pirate hunter,

524
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,916
I'll take your captain.

525
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,175
What the hell did you just do?

526
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,731
Right, are we done yet?

527
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,778
You're lousy at it.

528
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,364
But at least you do as you're told
in this kitchen.

529
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,325
If you think Sanji's gonna give up
on his dream because of you,

530
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,618
then forget it.

531
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,704
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

532
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,792
You may have banned him from the line,
but you can't stop him from cooking.

533
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,794
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

534
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,673
This starving pirate washed up earlier,
and you know what Sanji did?

535
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:37,009
He cooked for him,
right here in your kitchen,

536
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:41,514
because your rules matter less to him
than making sure a hungry man got fed.

537
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,684
He did that, did he?

538
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,769
What a good kid.

539
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,483
Luffy, we've got a problem.

540
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,736
Maybe you can convince him
to call it off.

541
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,323
- I won't do that.
- Did you see the size of that guy's sword?

542
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,993
- He will slice you into sashimi.
- What's going on?

543
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,286
I'll tell you what's going on.

544
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:07,331
Your big, bad Marine grandpa
sent a Warlord of the Sea to bring you in,

545
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,417
and instead of
getting the hell out of here,

546
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,002
Zoro challenged him to a duel.

547
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:11,919
Which he accepted.

548
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,840
You are a fly to him.
Something to be swatted and forgotten.

549
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,609
- Not if I win.
- You're not going to.

550
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,678
- You don't know that.
- Guys, guys, maybe we need more drinks.

551
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,647
Tell your first mate
he'll get himself killed.

552
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,392
Tell your navigator to butt out.

553
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,021
Maybe this isn't such a great idea, Zoro.

554
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,233
When you met me tied up on that cross,
what did I say?

555
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,152
"What makes you think
I wanna play pirates?"

556
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,487
- No, the other thing.
- "I kill your kind for a living"?

557
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,989
No. Come...

558
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,656
Oh.

559
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,621
That you made a promise to someone
a long time ago

560
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,289
to be the world's greatest swordsman.

561
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:52,543
The only way to do that is to beat Mihawk
in a duel and take his title.

562
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,754
I intend to do just that.

563
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,714
Even if you die in the process?

564
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,509
Will you please do something?

565
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,639
It's his dream, Nami.

566
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,392
I can't get in the way
of somebody's dream.

567
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,938
What's it gonna take, huh?

568
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,566
You want me to say you're the best?
You're the best. Okay?

569
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,903
You're the best I've ever seen,
but you are not better than him.

570
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,447
And if you fight him tomorrow,
you're going to lose.

571
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,782
Why do you give a shit?

572
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,701
Because you're my friend, you idiot.

573
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,830
You said it yourself.
You don't have any friends.

574
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,684
Well,

575
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,353
coming aboard?

576
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,881
Monkey D. Luffy.

577
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,720
I'm surprised the Marines would require
my services for such a small package.

578
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,974
- Though I do like your hat.
- Enough.

579
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,603
Let's begin.

580
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,988
What is that? I'm here for a sword fight.

581
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,074
I don't hunt rabbits with a cannon.

582
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,996
I'm no rabbit.

583
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,999
That remains to be seen.

584
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,820
Got you on the run, huh?

585
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,240
Hardly.

586
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,037
You're strong.

587
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,832
But fighting isn't all about strength.

588
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,375
Stop talking and fight.

589
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,379
You're like a little frog
croaking in a well.

590
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,381
Croak. Croak. Croak.

591
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:49,155
One of us will become the world's
greatest swordsman to ever live.

592
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,258
Why don't you retreat?

593
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,638
I can't...

594
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,435
or my dream will be lost forever.

595
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,321
You're brave. I'll give you that.

596
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,165
So I'll do you the honor
of killing you with Yoru.

597
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,927
That's more like it.

598
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,661
Come on.

599
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:54,530
You're defeated.
Why do you persist?

600
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:01,954
Wounds on the back
are a swordsman's greatest shame.

601
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,089
Magnificent.

602
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:35,988
Zoro!

603
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:49,126
Monkey D. Luffy,
what's your goal?

604
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,921
I'm going to become
the King of the Pirates.

605
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,215
King of the Pirates, hey?

606
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,678
That's a much more treacherous path
than even defeating me.

607
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,555
I don't care.

608
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,683
It's what I'm going to do.

609
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,309
Hmm.

610
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,270
Maybe you will at that.

611
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,650
This world could use
a few more wild cards.

612
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,194
Roronoa Zoro,

613
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,821
it's too soon for you to die.

614
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,824
Grow strong and come find me.

615
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,534
I'll be waiting.

616
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,628
He's losing so much blood.

617
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,839
He's gonna be okay.

618
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,008
Hey, Zoro, can you hear me?

619
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,470
He said it's too soon for you to die.

620
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,096
Luffy.

621
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:48,060
If I fail to become
the world's greatest swordsman...

622
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,856
you'll be disappointed.

623
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,482
Right?

624
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,360
You could never fail me.

625
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,489
Never...

626
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,367
again.

627
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,703
From now...

628
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:09,623
until I beat him.

629
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,255
To become the greatest swordsman...

630
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,884
I will never lose again!

631
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,684
Zoro?

632
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,443
Zoro?!

633
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,366
Zoro!
